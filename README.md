This was my first project in the area of reinforcement learning. The goal of the task was to have an AI balance a stick. More formally this is known as the interverted pendulem, where the center of mass is above the piviot point making it extremely unstable. However by activley moving the pivoit point it is posssible for the pendulem to become stable.
